data.py -- GPU-resident ImageNet-32 pipeline.

THE IDEA
--------
On CIFAR-10 we measured that the CPU augmentation pipeline was starving the GPU by 3x: one core
augments ~4,000 img/s while the card trains at ~13,000 img/s, so the GPU spent most of its life
waiting for Python.  The standard fix is more DataLoader workers.  Here we can do better and delete
the problem outright.

ImageNet-32's whole training set, as raw uint8, is:

    1,281,167 x 32 x 32 x 3 = 3.9 GB

The RTX PRO 6000 has 96 GB.  So we upload the ENTIRE DATASET to the GPU once, at startup, and
generate batches there.  Augmentation (random crop + horizontal flip) becomes a handful of tensor
ops on data that is already in VRAM.  The result:

  * no DataLoader, no worker processes, no 'spawn' problems, no persistent_workers
  * no PIL, no JPEG decode, no Python in the inner loop
  * no host->device copy per batch -- the data never leaves the GPU
  * the CPU is left completely free

This is the same trick as the GPU-resident hyperparameter sweep in CSED 503 A1, applied to images.
It only works because the images are tiny; you could not do this with 224x224 ImageNet (which would
be ~190 GB).  32x32 is what makes it possible.

# Strong augmentation for the transformers -- all of it on the GPU, all of it pure tensor math.
#
# WHY ONLY THE ViTs NEED THIS.  Our first ImageNet-32 run gave the ViTs only crop+flip, the same as
# the CNN, and they MEMORIZED the dataset: 97.4% train accuracy against 32.6% validation, a 65-point
# gap, on 1.28M images.  The ResNet, with the same augmentation, sat at a healthy +8.7% gap.
#
# That contrast IS the inductive bias, made visible.  A CNN cannot easily memorize -- weight sharing
# and locality physically restrict what it can represent, so the architecture regularizes itself for
# free.  A ViT has no such constraint: every token can attend to every other, so it has more than
# enough capacity to just learn the training set.  Augmentation is the SUBSTITUTE for the prior the
# transformer does not have.  This is why every real ViT recipe (DeiT and successors) ships with
# mixup + CutMix + erasing, and why a CNN recipe can get away without them.
